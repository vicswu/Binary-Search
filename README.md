# Binary-Search

Exercised done as introduction to Python in order to understand the language.
______________________________________________________________________________

The program will only accept 3 strings: "lo", "hi" and "c", to guide its search. <br/>

It will keep showing either the upper half using the higher value or the lower half using the lower value. <br/>

Any input (numbers, words) other than those 3 options will be rejected and the user will be asked to input once again.
